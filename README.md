# TumorCNN

Medical check-ups at times can be very time consuming and costly. For example, if a patient needs to get checked up for a possible Brain Tumor condition then the patient has to go through multiple layers of processing to get the final result.

First, the patient needs to visit a doctor who might further refer the patient to get an MRI scan and then an MRI image will be processed and then sent to the doctor who will conclude whether the person is suffering from a brain tumour or not.

As we can feel the above process can take days and sometimes even a whole week to complete the process and also requires a lot of labour, operators, equipment and additional workers for each process to be carried out.

But not anymore. With our revolutionary and carefully designed platform, we can detect the Brain Tumor’s possible presence in a patient within mere minutes. Even early-stage presence of Brain Tumor can be detected using our platform which might get unnoticed even by neurosurgery specialist. 

Our platform works using machine learning, which is first trained using specially designed data sets and using algorithms and statistical models to analyse and conclude results. 

Now the platform is ready and can give the result of a patient’s condition after just getting an MRI scan using an MRI machine and using scanned images to be used as an input to our trained machine learning-based platform and getting results after being precisely analysed within seconds. 

The machine uses CNN ( convolutional neural network) to analyse the image and give results using the prediction data to a maximum of 97 to 100 % accuracy. 

This can save the precious time of the patient while being cost-friendly by saving resources on unnecessary labour and multiple layers of the gruelling procedure.
